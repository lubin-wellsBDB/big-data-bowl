Instructions:
Clone this repository, copy the Big Databowl Dataset into the base level directory under the name "data." Before running the Python executables, ensure you've installed all the required python dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
The "ball carrier id to tackles csv. R" is where we created a new column for the tackles.csv that includes the ballCarrierId for that play. This was done in R by merging selected columns with the data sets tackles.csv and plays.csv.
The "all big data bowl R code.R" includes all of the R code in one file. To run this properly, have the plays, tackles, players, and all tracking data files in the working directory. Also have all csv's from python code in working directory before running.
